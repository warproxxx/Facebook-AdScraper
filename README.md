# AdScraper
Finds out the interest group to which facebook ads have been targeted. For a given facebook post URL, finds out pages liked by a user (if they are public). When all pages are scraped, finds intersection to find the common interest group targeted by the advertisers and saves in Heatmap and excel.

Also the facebook account password is in the code(ipynb). It is intentional. The password is already changed.
